			<p>We like making things, and back in October we decided to make soap. 
			</p>
			<p>Why soap? 
			</p>
			<p>Well, our work and many other projects we&apos;re involved with are digital, so it&apos;s really nice to balance that with something hands on. It&apos;s been fun to mix it up and make something tangible and sharable.
			</p>
			</p>So hey, friends and family&mdash;happy holidays! We&apos;ve really enjoyed making Paper Boat Soap and thinking of you all in the process.
